# Singer-s-Poem

I see my love \
I fly next to her \
I present her with my gift \
A small piece of solidified time \
lovely markings are carved into time \
As soft to the touch as the mud in shallow sea \
she covers her body with time \
and pulls me along to fly to the edge of existence \
this is a spiritual fight\
In our eyes, the stars appears as ghosts\
In the eyes of the stars, we appears as ghosts\
-- Cixin Liu, The Death's End\

\
I see my love \
I fly next to her \
I present her with my gift \
A small piece of hair spray\
lovely markings are carved into time\
As soft to the touch as the mud in shallow sea \
she covers her body with time \
and pulls me along to fly to the edge of wig\
This is a spiritual fight \
In our eyes, the stars appears as drumsticks \
In the eyes of the stars, we appears as drumsticks
